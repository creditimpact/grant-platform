# Security Report

## Implemented Changes

- Added API key authentication to AI Agent, AI Analyzer, and Eligibility Engine services.
- Secured the `/llm-debug/{session_id}` endpoint behind authentication and environment flag.
- Hardened file uploads in AI Analyzer with size limits (5MB) and ClamAV virus scanning.
- Enforced authenticated inter-service communication by sending `X-API-Key` headers and defaulting internal URLs to HTTPS.
- Enforced MongoDB authentication and TLS across services and documented least-privilege roles.
- Added simple in-memory rate limiting middleware to the Express server.
 - Added a script to verify MongoDB TLS connectivity (`npm run verify:mongo`).

## Further Recommendations

- Deploy a real virus scanning service (e.g., ClamAV daemon) and integrate with the analyzer.
- Replace in-memory rate limiting with a distributed solution like Redis for multi-instance deployments.
- Enable full HTTPS or mTLS across all services with proper certificates.
- Centralize logging and implement audit trails for authentication and data access.
- Conduct penetration testing to validate the security posture.
